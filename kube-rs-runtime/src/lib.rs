//! Crate with kubernetes runtime components
//!
//! This crate contains the core building blocks to allow users to build
//! controllers/operators/watchers that need to synchronize/reconcile kubernetes
//! state.
//!
//! Newcomers should generally get started with the `Controller` builder, which manages
//! all state internals for you.
